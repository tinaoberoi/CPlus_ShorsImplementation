# Shors-Algorithm-Simulation

This is CPP implementation of Shors. The classical part is parallelised using OpenMp. The performance is compared between Serial implementation, qiksit Shor's implementation and the parallel implementation.

For more implementation. Read here [Project Paper](./quantum_final_paper.pdf)
